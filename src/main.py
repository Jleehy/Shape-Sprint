main.py
Description:
    Serves as a testing ground for the initial implementation of a platform-style game with level progression,
    obstacles, checkpoints, and basic player control mechanics. The game simulates gravity, jumping, 
    object movement, collision detection, and platform interactions. It provides a main menu, pause functionality, 
    and level progression with checkpoints and a final end-of-level marker.

    Nov 9, 2024: Remove left and right arrow key movement - Jacob Leehy
    Nov 10, 2024: Patch checkpoint bugs and implement speed retention between checkpoints - Jacob Leehy
    Nov 10, 2024: Added volume up and down option to option menu - Steve Gan
    Nov 10, 2024: Split up functionality from test.py into main.py and into their respective modules. - Mario Simental
Preconditions:
    - Pygame and required custom modules (audio, engine, image, sound_effect) are installed and accessible.
    - Assets such as images and sound files are located in the specified file paths.
    - Screen resolution and display settings support the dimensions of game objects.
Postconditions:
    - The game loads the main menu and allows for progression through levels.
    - The player can interact with platforms, checkpoints, and obstacles according to the specified game logic.
    - The main menu and pause menu are responsive to user input.
Error Conditions:
    - Missing assets (images, audio files) could cause load failures or display errors.
    - Invalid input or out-of-bound interactions may cause unexpected object behavior or freezes.
    - Collisions may behave unexpectedly if objects are incorrectly positioned.
Side Effects:
    - Modifies global game state and transitions between game states (e.g., main menu, pause, play).
    - Alters the screen buffer and renders images each frame.
    - Plays background music and sound effects based on game state.
Invariants:
    - The Cube object must remain within level boundaries except when falling off-screen at the game end.
    - Gravity and jump strength values must be non-zero to ensure continuous vertical movement.
    - Collision detection with non-flag objects stops vertical velocity, while flag collisions do not.
    - The main menu selection cycling remains within bounds (0-2).  
Known Faults:
    - Itâ€™s possible to jump over the end flag and fall off-screen.
    - The cube sprite may be pushed slightly out of its locked position on rare occasions.
    - Restart after completing the level doesn't ignore checkpoints
